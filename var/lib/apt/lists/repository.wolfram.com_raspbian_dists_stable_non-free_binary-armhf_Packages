Description: Mathematica® and the Wolfram Language
 Mathematica is the world's ultimate application for computations and the only development platform fully integrating computation into complete workflows, moving you seamlessly from initial ideas all the way to deployed individual or enterprise solutions.
 .
 Wolfram Language is the result of more than 25 years of leading-edge language development. Unique in its philosophy of building in a vast array of algorithms, knowledge, and interfaces, its goal is to be the world's smartest and most productive programming language--and the shortest path from ideas to deployed code.
