Description: wayland compositor infrastructure - development files
 Wayland is a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients as well
 as a C library implementation of that protocol. The compositor can be
 a standalone display server running on Linux kernel modesetting and
 evdev input devices, an X application, or a wayland client
 itself. The clients can be traditional applications, X servers
 (rootless or fullscreen) or other display servers.
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the libraries found
 in libwayland0. Non-developers likely have little use for this package.

 This is an experimental library package, neither ABI or API are fixed
 right now. As a consequence, generated dependencies are made as
 strict as possible. It should only be used by mesa and weston for
 the time being.

Description: library interface to the XKB compiler - development files
 xkbcommon is a library to handle keyboard descriptions, including loading them
 from disk, parsing them and handling their state. It's mainly meant for client
 toolkits, window systems, and other system applications; currently that
 includes Wayland, kmscon, GTK+, Clutter, and more.

Description: reference implementation of a Wayland compositor
 Part of the Wayland project is also the Weston reference implementation
 of a Wayland compositor. Weston can run as an X client or under Linux
 KMS and ships with a few demo clients. The Weston compositor is a minimal
 and fast compositor and is suitable for many embedded and mobile use
 cases.
