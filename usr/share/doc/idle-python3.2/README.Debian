  The Python IDLE package for Debian
  ----------------------------------

This package contains Python 3.2's Integrated DeveLopment Environment, IDLE.

IDLE is included in the Python 3.2 upstream distribution (Tools/idle) and
depends on Tkinter (available as python3.2-tk package).

I have written a simple man page.
