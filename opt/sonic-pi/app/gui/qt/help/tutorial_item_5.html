<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">OK, enough of the intros - let’s get into some sound.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">In this section we’ll cover the basis of triggering and manipulating
synths. Synth is short for synthesiser which is a fancy word for
something which creates sounds. Typically synths are quite complicated
to use - especially analog synths with many patch wires and
modules. However, Sonic Pi gives you much of that power in a very simple
and approachable manner. </p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">Don’t be fooled by the immediate simplicity of Sonic Pi’s interface. You
can get very deep into very sophisticated sound manipulation if that’s
your thing. Hold on to your hats…</p>
