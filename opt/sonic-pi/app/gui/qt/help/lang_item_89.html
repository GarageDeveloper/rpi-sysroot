Allows you assign the result of some code to a name with the property that the code will only execute once therefore stopping re-definitions. This is useful for defining values that you use in your compositions but you don't want to reset every time you press run. You may force the block to execute again regardless of whether or not it has executed once already by using the override option (see examples).
