This is the main method for playing back recorded sound files (samples). Sonic Pi comes with lots of great samples included (see the section under help) but you can also load and play wav|wave|aif|aiff files from anywhere on your computer too. The 'rate' parameter affects both the speed and the pitch of the playback. See the examples for details. Check out the use_sample_pack and use_sample_pack_as methods for details on making it easy to work with a whole folder of your own sample files. Note, that on the first trigger of a sample, Sonic Pi has to load the sample which takes some time and may cause timing issues. To preload the samples you wish to work with consider load_sample and load_samples.
