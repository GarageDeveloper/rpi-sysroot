<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">This concludes the Sonic Pi introductory tutorial. Hopefully you’ve
learned something along the way. Don’t worry if you feel you didn’t
understand everything - just play and have fun and you’ll pick things up
in your own time. Feel free to dive back in when you have a question that
might be covered in one of the sections.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">If you have any questions that haven’t been covered in the tutorial,
then please jump onto the <a style="text-decoration: none; color:dodgerblue;" href="http://groups.google.com/group/sonic-pi/">Sonic Pi forums</a>
and ask your question there. You’ll find someone friendly and willing to
lend a hand.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">Finally, I also invite you to take a deeper look at the rest of the
documentation in this help system. There are a number of features that
haven’t been covered in this tutorial that are waiting for your
discovery.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">So play, have fun, share your code, perform for your friends, show your
screens and remember:</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;"><em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">There are no mistakes, only opportunities.</em></p>
