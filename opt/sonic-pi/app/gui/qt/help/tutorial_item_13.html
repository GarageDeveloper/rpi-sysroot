<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;"> <span style="font-size:25px; color:white;background-color:deeppink;">Stretching Samples</span></p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">Now that we can play a variety of synths and samples to create some music,
it’s time to learn how to modify both the synths and samples to make the
music even more unique and interesting. First, let’s explore the ability
to <em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">stretch</em> and <em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">squash</em> samples.</p>

<br><p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;"><span style="font-size:20px; color:white; background-color:dodgerblue;">Sample Representation</span></p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">Samples are pre-recorded sounds stored as numbers which represent how to
move the speaker cone to reproduce the sound. The speaker cone can move
in and out, and so the numbers just need to represent how far in and out
the cone needs to be for each moment in time. To be able to faithfully
reproduce a recorded sound the sample typically needs to store many
thousands of numbers per second! Sonic Pi takes this list of numbers and
feeds them at the right speed to move your computer’s speaker in and out
in just the right way to reproduce the sound. However, it’s also fun to
change the speed with which the numbers are fed to the speaker to change
the sound.</p>

<br><p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;"><span style="font-size:20px; color:white; background-color:dodgerblue;">Changing Rate</span></p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">Let’s play with one of the ambient sounds: <code style="font-size:15px; color:deeppink; background-color:white">:ambi_choir</code>. To play it
with the default rate, you can pass a <code style="font-size:15px; color:deeppink; background-color:white">rate:</code> argument to <code style="font-size:15px; color:deeppink; background-color:white">sample</code>:</p>

<pre><code style="font-size:15px; color:deeppink; background-color:white">sample :ambi_choir, rate: 1
</code></pre>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">This plays it at normal rate (1), so nothing special yet. However, we’re
free to change that number to something else. How about <code style="font-size:15px; color:deeppink; background-color:white">0.5</code>:</p>

<pre><code style="font-size:15px; color:deeppink; background-color:white">sample :ambi_choir, rate: 0.5
</code></pre>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">Woah! What’s going on here? Well, two things. Firstly, the sample takes
twice as long to play, secondly the sound is an octave lower. Let’s
explore these things in a little more detail.</p>

<br><p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;"><span style="font-size:20px; color:white; background-color:dodgerblue;">Let’s stretch</span></p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">A sample that’s fun to stretch and compress is the Amen Break. At normal
rate, we might imagine throwing it into a <em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">drum ‘n’ bass</em> track:</p>

<pre><code style="font-size:15px; color:deeppink; background-color:white">sample :loop_amen
</code></pre>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">However by changing the rate we can switch up genres. Try half speed for
<em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">old school hip-hop</em>:</p>

<pre><code style="font-size:15px; color:deeppink; background-color:white">sample :loop_amen, rate: 0.5
</code></pre>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">If we speed it up, we enter <em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">jungle</em> territory: </p>

<pre><code style="font-size:15px; color:deeppink; background-color:white">sample :loop_amen, rate: 1.5
</code></pre>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">Now for our final party trick - let’s see what happens if we use a
negative rate:</p>

<pre><code style="font-size:15px; color:deeppink; background-color:white">sample :loop_amen, rate: -1
</code></pre>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">Woah! It plays it <em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">backwards</em>! Now try playing with lots of different
samples at different rates. Try very fast rates. Try crazy slow
rates. See what interesting sounds you can produce.</p>

<br><p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;"><span style="font-size:20px; color:white; background-color:dodgerblue;">A Simple Explanation of Sample Rate</span></p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">A useful way to think of samples is as springs. Playback rate is like
squashing and stretching the spring. If you play the sample at rate 2,
you’re <em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">squashing the spring</em> to half its normal length. The sample
therefore takes half the amount of time to play as it’s shorter. If you
play the sample at half rate, you’re <em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">stretching the spring</em> to double
its length. The sample therefore takes twice the amount of time to play
as it’s longer. The more you squash (higher rate), the shorter it gets,
the more you stretch (lower rate), the longer it gets.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">Compressing a spring increases its density (the number of coils per cm)
- this is similar to the sample sounding <em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">higher pitched</em>. Stretching
the spring decreases its density and is similar to the sound having a
<em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">lower pitch</em>.</p>

<br><p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;"><span style="font-size:20px; color:white; background-color:dodgerblue;">The Maths Behind Sample Rate</span></p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">(This section is provided for those that are interested in the
details. Please feel free to skip it…)</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">As we saw above, a sample is represented by a big long list of numbers
representing where the speaker should be through time. We can take this
list of numbers and use it to draw a graph which would look similar to
this:</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;"><img src=":/images/tutorial/sample.png" alt="sample graph" /></p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">You might have seen pictures like this before. It’s called the
<em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">waveform</em> of a sample. It’s just a graph of numbers. Typically a
waveform like this will have 44100 points of data per second (this is
due to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem). So, if the sample lasts
for 2 seconds, the waveform will be represented by 88200 numbers which
we would feed to the speaker at a rate of 44100 points per second. Of
course, we could feed it at double rate which would be 88200 points per
second. This would therefore take only 1 second to play back. We could
also play it back at half rate which would be 22050 points per second
taking 4 seconds to play back.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">The duration of the sample is affected by the playback rate: </p>

<ul style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">
  <li>Doubling the playback rate halves the playback time,</li>
  <li>Halving the playback rate doubles the playback time,</li>
  <li>Using a playback rate of one fourth quadruples the playback time,</li>
  <li>Using a playback rate of 1/10 makes playback last 10 times longer.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">We can represent this with the formula:</p>

<pre><code style="font-size:15px; color:deeppink; background-color:white">new_sample_duration = (1 / rate) * sample_duration 
</code></pre>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">Changing the playback rate also affects the pitch of the sample. The
frequency or pitch of a waveform is determined by how fast it moves up
and down. Our brains somehow turn fast movement of speakers into high
notes and slow movement of speakers into low notes. This is why you can
sometimes even see a big bass speaker move as it pumps out super low
bass - it’s actually moving a lot slower in and out than a speaker
producing higher notes.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">If you take a waveform and squash it it will move up and down more times
per second. This will make it sound higher pitched. It turns out that
doubling the amount of up and down movements (oscillations) doubles the
frequency. So, <em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">playing your sample at double rate will double the
frequency you hear it</em>. Also, <em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">halving the rate will halve the
frequency</em>. Other rates will affect the frequency accordingly.</p>
