<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">A very useful tool in a programmer’s toolkit is a data structure.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">Sometimes you may wish to represent and use more than one thing. For
example, you may find it useful to have a series of notes to play one
after another. Programming languages have data structures to allow you
do exactly this.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">There are many exciting and exotic data structures available to
programmers - and people are always inventing new ones. However, for now
we only really need to consider a very simple data structure - the list.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">Let’s look at it in more detail. We’ll cover its basic form and then
also how lists can be used to represent scales and chords.</p>
