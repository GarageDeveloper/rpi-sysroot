<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;"> <span style="font-size:25px; color:white;background-color:deeppink;">Welcome friend :-)</span></p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">Welcome to Sonic Pi! Hopefully you’re as excited to get started making crazy sounds as I am to show you. It’s going to be a really <em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">fun</em> ride where you’ll learn all about music, synthesis, programming, composition, performance and more!</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">But wait, how rude of me! Let me introduce myself - I’m <em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">Sam Aaron</em> - the chap that created Sonic Pi. You can find me at <em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">@samaaron</em> on Twitter and I’d be more than happy to say hello to you. If you have any thoughts, praise, or even grief to pass on - please do. Feedback is so helpful for improving Sonic Pi. You never know, your idea might be the next big feature!</p>

<br><p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;"><span style="font-size:20px; color:white; background-color:dodgerblue;">There are no mistakes</span></p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">Before we start, let me just give you one piece of advice I’ve learned over my years of live coding with music - <em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">there are no mistakes, only opportunities</em>. This is something I’ve often heard in relation to jazz but it works equally well with live coding. No matter how experienced you are - from a complete beginner to a seasoned Algoraver, you’ll run some code that has a completely unexpected outcome. It might sound insanely cool - in which case run with it. However, it might sound totally jarring and out of place. It doesn’t matter that it happened - what matters is what you do next with it. Take the sound, manipulate it and morph it into something awesome. The crowd will go <em style="font-size:15px;color:darkorange;">wild</em>.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">Whilst Sonic Pi is good for composing music out of code, it’s live coding where it truly shines. In this tutorial we’ll take you on a journey from making simple beeps and bleeps to live coding your own Algorave performance. Take a deep breath, here we go….</p>
