<p style="font-size:15px;color:#5e5e5e;">One of the most exciting aspects of Sonic Pi is that it enables you to

feedback whilst composing (get a simple loop running and keep tweaking
it till it sounds just perfect). However, the main advantage is that you
can take Sonic Pi on stage and gig with it.</p>
