Cell["\<\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with \
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is \
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who \
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a \
manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. \
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product \
offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to \
defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") \
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from \
claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the \
Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such \
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in \
a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply \
to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual \
property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: \
a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and \
b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the \
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement \
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim \
at its own expense.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product \
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If \
that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers \
warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are \
such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the \
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other \
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a \
court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the \
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\

Cell["\<\
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and \
other kinds of works.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take \
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General \
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all \
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its \
users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License \
for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way \
by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our \
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom \
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that \
you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the \
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can \
do these things.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these \
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain \
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify \
it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or \
for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you \
received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source \
code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) \
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you \
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that \
there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' \
sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that \
their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous \
versions.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified \
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. \
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom \
to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the \
area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most \
unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit \
the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in \
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in \
future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States \
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on \
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special \
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively \
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to \
render the program non-free.\

\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\

\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of \
works, such as semiconductor masks.\

\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. \
Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may \
be individuals or organizations.\

Cell["\<\
To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a \
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact \
copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work \
or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the \
Program.\

Cell["\<\
To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without \
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement \
under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or \
modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or \
without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries \
other activities as well.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties \
to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer \
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the \
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) \
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there \
is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are \
provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to \
view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user \
commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this \
criterion. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["1. Source Code.", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for \
making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a \
work.\

Cell["\<\
A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official \
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of \
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is \
widely used among developers working in that language.\

Cell["\<\
The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than \
the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a \
Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) \
serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to \
implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to \
the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means \
a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the \
specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a \
compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run \
it.\

The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the \

object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those \
activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or \
general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used \
unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. \
For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files \
associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared \
libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically \
designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow \
between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid \
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is \
effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered \

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, \
which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are \
not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a \
storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation \
and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights \

either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the \
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium \

reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) \
access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. \

code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the \
Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third \
party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain \
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the \
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding \
Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as \

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to \

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not \

it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free \
programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\

Cell["\<\
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors \
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These \

copies of the library or if you modify it.\

Cell["\<\
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a \

make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link \
other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the \
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making \
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms \
so they know their rights.\

distribute and/or modify the library.\

Cell["\<\
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no \
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone \
else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the \
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be \

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free \

of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in \
this license.\

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU \

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared \

criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax \
criteria for linking other code with the library.\

Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. \

ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser \
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\

Cell["\<\
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the \
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto \

widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by \
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General \
Public License.\

Cell["\<\
\t1. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants \
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to \
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, \
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and \
such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
\t2. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants \
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under \
Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise \
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and \
object code form.This patent license shall apply to the combination of the \
Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the \
Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be \
covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any \
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is \
licensed hereunder.
\t3. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses \
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any \
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other \
intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims \
any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on \
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to \
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby \
assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights \
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to \
allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility \
to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
\t4. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient \
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license \
set forth in this Agreement.\

conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or \
conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and \
consequential damages, such as lost profits;

Cell["\<\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with \
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is \
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who \
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a \
manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. \
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product \
offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to \
defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") \
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from \
claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the \
Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such \
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in \
a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply \
to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual \
property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must : \
a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and \
b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the \
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement \
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim \
at its own expense.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product \
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If \
that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers \
warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are \
such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the \
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other \
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a \
court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the \
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\

is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any \
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that \
the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software \

Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) \
under the new version. No one other than IBM has the right to modify this \
Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, \

infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to \
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby \
assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights \

allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility \
to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\

Cell["\<\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with \
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is \
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who \
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a \
manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. \
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product \
offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to \
defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") \
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from \
claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the \
Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such \
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in \
a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply \
to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual \
property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: \

Cell["\<\
a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and \

b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the \
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement \
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim \
at its own expense.\

Cell["\<\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product \
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If \
that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers \
warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are \
such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the \
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other \
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a \
court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the \
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\

to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim \

Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation \
is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any \
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that \
the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software \

Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the \
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate \

version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be \
distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was \
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, \
Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) \
under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) \
